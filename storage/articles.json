Specifically, it\u2019s releasing Giphy Arcade, a platform for making, hosting, and playing \u201cmicrogames\u201d constructed out of gifs.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering how in the heck Giphy and games go together, don\u2019t worry \u2014 it took me by surprise too. But Giphy is one of those companies that seems to be trying to expand beyond its original mandate, and in this case it\u2019s leveraging its massive library of gifs as assets for bite-sized games.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"jwplayer-placeholder\">\n                <div id=\"jwplayerInlineAd\"><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <script src=\"\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/libraries\/vRZNU7bT.js\"> <\/script><script>\n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            <\/script><div class=\"ica-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ica-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/bowlr\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"In Article Block\" data-event-label=\"Let\u2019s go bowling\" target=\"_blank\"><h4>Let\u2019s go bowling<\/h4>\n<p>Join us on Dec. 11 for the ultimate team outing<\/p><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"ica-button\">\n                    <a class=\"button gtm-in-article-block\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"In Article Block\" data-event-label=\"YES\" href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/bowlr\" target=\"_blank\">YES<\/a>\n                <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Nick\u00a0Santaniello, Giphy\u2018s senior product engineer, said in a statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When exploring what games could look like for GIPHY, we knew the experience had to be quick, shareable, and accessible for everyone, including people who don\u2019t necessarily have a history with gaming. With GIPHY Arcade, we\u2019ve created an experience that provides not only instant fun for the player, but also a new way to add personalized expression and entertainment to conversations as they\u2019re happening.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Giphy Arcade games are designed to be made, played, and shared in a matter of seconds. They\u2019re not complex \u2014 most of the ones already created look like\u00a0<em>Flappy Bird<\/em> meets a YTMND fired out of Nyan Cat\u2019s backside.

Everything is free and simple to access.<\/p>\n<p>Users can also \u201cremix\u201d games, meaning put a new spin on the gameplay by changing up the in-game assets. Don\u2019t wanna bust bricks? You can change up the game by using its template and selecting specific things to replace the bricks, sliding paddle, and bouncy thing. So if, for example, you wanted to change a brick buster into a game in which Ken from Street Fighter bounces a disco ball off of pizza slices in front of Wendy\u2019s posterboard\u2026<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1250007 lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"775\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/10\/Giphy-Arcade-Game.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/10\/Giphy-Arcade-Game.jpg 544w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/10\/Giphy-Arcade-Game-147x210.jpg 147w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/10\/Giphy-Arcade-Game-190x270.jpg 190w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/10\/Giphy-Arcade-Game-95x135.jpg 95w\"><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, this stuff is\u00a0<em>trippy as heck<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>While anyone can make these microgames, I can see this being something businesses take advantage of \u2014 Wendy\u2019s has already partnered with Giphy on this experiment, because of course it has.

You\u2019ll have to decide if you\u2019re going to be using a strictly-software solution, like <a href=\"https:\/\/online.berklee.edu\/takenote\/programming-drum-beats-with-your-daw\/#targetText=So%2C%20drop%20your%20virtual%20drum,way%20to%20drop%20your%20beats.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">programming beats in a DAW<\/a> \u2013 these let you make beats using your mouse and keyboard or touch screen interface \u2013 or if you\u2019ll be using hardware. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Personally, I prefer having the option to do both so I use hardware.

These can be hot-swapped in and out and the Morph is resilient enough to handle the same kind of pounding that a full-on drum machine can. This means you can play your melodies on piano keys, tap out your bass lines on regular pads, and then break out a pair of actual drum sticks to lay down snares and hi-hats. None of this requires you to push buttons, change settings, or even click the mouse \u2013 of course, you\u2019ll have to change instruments in your DAW or production suite, but the Morph features seamless transition and recognition. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>Microphone<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1233309 aligncenter lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"470\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/07\/spire3.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/07\/spire3.jpg 453w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/07\/spire3-202x210.jpg 202w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/07\/spire3-260x270.jpg 260w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/07\/spire3-130x135.jpg 130w\"><figcaption>Credit: Nicole Gray<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><span>Here\u2019s where you need to think outside of the box. You can\u2019t fit half a dozen mics in a backpack, and most decent cardioid condenser mics require a pre-amp, bulky cables, a microphone stand with specialty mount, a pop-filter, and a solid case to keep it from getting bumped around. You probably don\u2019t want to be slinging your $500 microphone around loose inside of your backpack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Instead of carrying a studio-quality mic around to record in places where you likely won\u2019t be able to control the ambient noise or guarantee proper acoustic resonance, you can use a \u201cjam station\u201d style recording solution like <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2019\/08\/02\/i-let-izotopes-ai-handle-the-mixing-in-my-recording-studio-and-now-im-on-the-machines-side\/\">Izotope\u2019s Spire Studio<\/a> or simply use less expensive handheld microphones like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Shure-SM58-LC-Vocal-Microphone-Cardioid\/dp\/B000CZ0R42\/?tag=tnw88-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Shure SM58<\/a>.

And you can record individual vocal or acoustic guitar tracks with something like the Shure SM58 (vocals) or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Shure-SM57-LC-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone\/dp\/B0000AQRST\/?tag=tnw88-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Shure SM57<\/a>\u00a0(acoustic instruments).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>Interface<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1182898 aligncenter lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1093\" height=\"820\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo.jpg\" data-lazy=\"true\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo.jpg 1093w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-280x210.jpg 280w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-360x270.jpg 360w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-180x135.jpg 180w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-796x597.jpg 796w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-368x276.jpg 368w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-736x552.jpg 736w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-632x474.jpg 632w, https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2019\/01\/Komplete-Audio-1-2-combo-536x402.jpg 536w\"><figcaption>Credit: Native Instruments<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><span>This is the easy part. Your MIDI controller should plug directly into your laptop, but for electric guitars, keyboards, electronic drums, and most microphones you\u2019ll need and interface. While some interfaces are huge, rack-mounted pieces of gear, you can easily find an interface that supports between 2 and 4 inputs for relatively cheap and they typically don\u2019t take up much more space than a Bluetooth speaker would. I use a Roland <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/plugged\/2018\/11\/19\/rolands-gomixer-pro-is-a-youtube-musicians-best-friend\/\">Go:Mixer PRO<\/a> because it\u2019s tiny, can run on battery power, and is super easy to use.

I keep guitar picks, drumsticks, extra USB cords, batteries, and a few memory sticks in my backpack. I also have a pop-filter because I do travel with a condenser mic and a cobbled-together mini-microphone stand that fits in my backpack. But if you\u2019ve got a computer to record to, the right instruments and mics for your project, and all the MIDI-controllers you need (if any), you should be good to go.

Saves and achievements transfer across those platforms. So any game you play on PC or One that\u2019s also available on the Scarlett will be able to transfer over to the new console.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that wasn\u2019t available on the last generational transition. Spencer acknowledges this was a misstep on his company\u2019s part, especially since it would have been possible: \u201c<span>We talked about how important digital was going to be this generation, and yet we didn\u2019t move the digital purchases that you\u2019d made on 360 seamlessly over to Xbox One.\u00a0 I always thought that was a miss.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Presumably this would make the transfer between the Xbox One and Scarlett easier \u2014 if you want to play\u00a0<em>Halo: Infinite<\/em> (at the moment, the only cross-generation title on the Xbox One and Scarlett that we know of), but can\u2019t yet afford Scarlett, you can get started on PC and be able to transfer your progress to the Scarlett when you get it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not something that\u2019ll have an obvious benefit immediately after the console goes on sale.\u00a0Microsoft will no doubt hype up the next-gen exclusives it has ahead of the all-important holiday sales season. But still, given there\u2019s always an in-between period where games are released for both platforms, this would help lessen the stress of those who want the new console, but can\u2019t buy it\u00a0<em>just yet<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As a side note, Microsoft\u00a0<em>really\u00a0<\/em>needs to reveal what the heck it intends to call the Scarlett\u2019s final form. At this point I\u2019ve become way too comfortable calling this thing the Scarlett, and I need time to unlearn that before the device officially goes on sale in year. They could just ditch pretense and go for calling the thing \u201cScarlett\u201d permanently, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole Microsoft think tank that came up with something boring like the \u201cXbox Two.\u201d<\/p>                            \n\n                            <div class=\"post-in-content-tags\">\n                                <span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/company\/microsoft\/\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Tags\" data-event-label=\"Microsoft\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\">Microsoft<\/a><\/span><span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/section\/play\/\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Tags\" data-event-label=\"Play\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\">Play<\/a><\/span><span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/topic\/xbox\/\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Tags\" data-event-label=\"Xbox\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\">Xbox<\/a><\/span><span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/vocabulary\/microsoft-2-2\/\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Tags\" data-event-label=\"Microsoft\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\">Microsoft<\/a><\/span><span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/vocabulary\/xbox-one\/\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Tags\" data-event-label=\"Xbox One\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\">Xbox One<\/a><\/span>                            <\/div>\n\n                        <\/div>","image_file":"microsoft-wants-xbox-scarlett-to-support-cross-gen-play-anywhere.jpg"}]
